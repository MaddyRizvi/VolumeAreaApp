# Volume Calculator App

## Description
This Android app, built using **Java** and **Android Studio**, allows users to calculate the volume of different 3D shapes: **Sphere**, **Cylinder**, **Cube**, and **Prism**. The app currently implements the volume calculation for a **Sphere** and allows users to enter the radius to compute the volume. The app is open-source and provides a foundation for adding other shapes (Cylinder, Cube, and Prism). Users are encouraged to clone the repository and extend the functionality to include these additional shapes.

## Features
- **Sphere Volume Calculation**: The app calculates the volume of a sphere when the user enters the radius.
- **Future Extensions**: The app allows easy integration for additional shapes such as Cylinder, Cube, and Prism.
- **Open Source**: The app is open-source, and contributions for adding new shapes are welcome.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Android Studio**
- **Android SDK**

## Shapes and Volume Formulas
### 1. **Sphere**
   - Formula: \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \)
   - Input: **Radius (r)**

### 2. **Cylinder**
   - Formula: \( V = \pi r^2 h \)
   - Input: **Radius (r)**, **Height (h)**

### 3. **Cube**
   - Formula: \( V = a^3 \)
   - Input: **Side length (a)**

### 4. **Prism**
   - Formula: \( V = A_b h \)
   - Input: **Base Area (A_b)**, **Height (h)**

Currently, only the **Sphere** implementation is provided, but users can add the other shapes by following the app's structure.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Enter the radius for the **Sphere** and click **Calculate** to get the volume.
4. For further functionality (Cylinder, Cube, and Prism), extend the code by adding the corresponding volume calculation logic for each shape.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/MaddyRizvi/VolumeAreaApp.git
